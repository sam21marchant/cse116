Question 1:
object Q1 {

 def checkListOfGrades(listOfGrades: List[Int]): String = {
   var result = “”
   for (grade <- listOfGrades) {
     result += checkGrade(grade, 65)
   }
   result
 }

 def checkGrade(grade: Int, cutoff: Int): String = {
   if (grade > cutoff) {
     “Passed with grade of: “ + grade + “\n”
   } else {
     “Failed with grade: “ + grade + “\n”
   }
 }

 def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
   val gradeList: List[Int] = List(75, 56, 94)
   val result: String = checkListOfGrades(gradeList)
   println(result)
 }

}

Q1(20 points): What is printed to the screen when this program is executed?



Question 2:

/**
 * Returns the average of the values in the input list of integers.
 * If the list is empty, returns 0.0
 */
def computeAverage(input: List[Int]): Double = {
   val sum: Double = 0.0
   for (number <- input) {
     sum += number
   }
   sum / input.length
}

Q2(20 points): This method contains 2 errors. Identify and describe both errors



Question 3:

object Q3 {
 def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
   val level: Int = 1
   val player: DragonBorn = new DragonBorn(new OneHanded(level))
   player.levelUpOneHanded()
   player.levelUpOneHanded() //THIS IS THE HIGHLIGHTED LINE
   println(player.oneHanded.skillLevel)
 }
}

class DragonBorn(val oneHanded: OneHanded){
 def levelUpOneHanded(): Unit = {
   oneHanded.skillLevel += 1
 }
}

class OneHanded(var skillLevel: Int){}


Q3a(5 points): What is printed to the screen when this program is executed?



Q3b(25 points): Draw the state of the stack and heap immediately before the highlighted line is executed. Include all names and values of variables and specify which values are stored on the stack and which are stored on the heap.



Question 4:

object Q4 {

 def getTotalCost(input: List[Double]): Double = {
   val criteria: Double = 5.0
   var cost: Double = 0
   for(price <- input){
     if(price < criteria){
       cost = cost + applyTax(value)
     }
   }
   cost
 }

 def applyTax(input: Double): Double = {
   val cost: Double = input + (input * .1)
   cost // THIS IS THE HIGHLIGHTED LINE
 }

 def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
   val pricesOfItems: List[Double] = List(2.0,11.0,3.0)
   val cost: Double = getTotalCost(pricesOfItems)
   println(cost)
 }

}


Q4a(5 points): What is printed to the screen when this program is executed?



Q4b(25 points): Draw the state of the stack and heap immediately before the first time the highlighted line is executed. Include all names and values of variables and specify which values are stored on the stack and which are stored on the heap.
